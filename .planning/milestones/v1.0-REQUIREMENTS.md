## v2 Requirements (Deferred)

Tracked but not implemented in v1.0:

### Advanced Features

- **PDF-01**: Export calculation to branded PDF
- **SCENARIO-01**: Compare multiple battery configurations side-by-side
- **TEMPLATE-01**: Create calculation templates for faster quoting
- **BULK-01**: Bulk user import via CSV

### Enterprise Features

- **SSO-01**: SAML/OIDC single sign-on integration
- **API-01**: REST API for CRM integration
- **DOMAIN-01**: Custom subdomain per organization

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded from v1.0:

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Real-time spot price display | Prices change constantly, creates confusion and liability |
| Customer self-registration | Spam risk, admin-controlled access preferred |
| AI consumption estimates | Unreliable, liability risk |
| Multi-currency support | Swedish market only, SEK hardcoded |
| In-app chat/messaging | Scope creep, use email instead |
| Automatic contract generation | Legal complexity outside scope |
| Battery comparison shopping | Not a price comparison site |
| Complex approval workflows | Over-engineering for initial market |
| Solar panel calculations | Batteries only for v1 |
| Mobile app | Web-first approach |
